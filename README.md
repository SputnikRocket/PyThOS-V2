# PyThOS

### PyThOS is a python script designed to simulate an operating system with a shell.

* Has several shell themes, including bash, zsh, fish, and altzsh(A stylized zsh theme, similar to Oh-my-zsh's "duellj" theme.)

* Has some eyecandy, like a boot splash and colors 

* Has some executable commands built in, such as exit, clear, yuptime(only reports host uptime for now), cmds(lists available commands), and counter, which just counts really fast.

**Notes:**
* "clear" doesn't work on windows, as it uses Unix "clear" command. the boot splash also depends on "clear"

depends: `colorama`

example usage:

`./start.sh`

`./start.sh <theme>`
